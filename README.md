Creating a README file for your project is a great way to provide essential information about its purpose, setup, and usage. Below is a brief and concise README template for your ItemTracker C++ project, which assumes the presence of the Makefile and all necessary source files. You can customize this template according to the specifics of your project or environment requirements.

### README.md for ItemTracker Program

---

#### Project Overview
This `ItemTracker` program is designed for the Corner Grocer to analyze daily sales data and display item purchase frequencies. It provides functionalities to search for a specific item's frequency, print a list of all items with their frequencies, and visualize these frequencies through a histogram.

#### Features
- **Search by Item**: Input an item name to retrieve its purchase frequency.
- **Display Frequencies**: View a list of all items and their purchase frequencies.
- **Histogram View**: Generate a histogram showing the frequency of purchases per item.

#### Prerequisites
- C++ Compiler (preferably GCC)
- Make (for building the project using the Makefile)

#### Installation and Compilation
1. **Clone the repository or download source files**: Ensure `main.cpp`, `ItemTracker.cpp`, `ItemTracker.h`, and the `Makefile` are in the same directory.
2. **Build the project**:
   - Navigate to the project directory.
   - Run `make` to compile the program. This creates the `ItemTrackerProgram` executable.

#### Usage
- **Run the program**: After building, execute the program by running `./ItemTrackerProgram` in the terminal.
- **Interact with the menu**:
  - Choose `1` to search for an item's frequency.
  - Choose `2` to display all items' frequencies.
  - Choose `3` to view the histogram.
  - Choose `4` to exit the program.

#### Cleaning up
- To clean up the compiled files, run `make clean` in the project directory. This will remove the executable and all object files.

#### Contributing
- Contributions to this project are welcome. Please ensure to update this README if you think your changes require it.
